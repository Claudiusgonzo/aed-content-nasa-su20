# Determine the Precise Rocket Launch Question to Ask

"And we will use the AI and Machine Learning algorithms to process these data to learn and discover patterns, then we will use these pattern to decide if a day is good for a rocket launch or not."

In a future learning path, we will add the NASA satelite imagery data to better decide if the earth atmosphere conditions are good for launch
