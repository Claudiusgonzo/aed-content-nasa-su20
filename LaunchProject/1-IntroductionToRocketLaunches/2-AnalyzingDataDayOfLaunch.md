# Analyze Weather the Day of Rocket Launches to Determine Safety

While historical and prediction data are critical, and are often correct because of the care NASA scientists take to make the choice, there are also a number of factors analyzed the day of a launch.

Some examples of where NASA collects their data from:
- [High-atmospheric Scientific Balloons](https://www.nasa.gov/scientificballoons)
- [NOAA Weather](https://www.noaa.gov/weather)
- [Satellite imagery](https://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/GOES/)
- [Remote sensors](https://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/learn/remote-sensors)
- The expertise of folks who study and understand the implications of weather patterns in 

Some key factors that NASA takes into account regarding launches are:
- Surface Electric Field
- Time
- Distance
- Cloud Temperature
- Percipitation Intensity
- Rocket Velocity

The 45th Space Wing (a division of the United States Air Force that focuses on space exploration and weather relating to successful rocket launches) has compiled an easy to follow graphic to explain some of the critical criteria that is taken into consideration leading up to a launch.

## The Importance of Clouds

Temperature and lightning are huge factors in rocket launches. Each rocket has different temperature requirements depending on how it was built and what cargo it is holding. And so the exact criteria will be dependent on the rocket and proprietary information. But generally, there are thresholds for temperature that will lead to the success or failure of a launch. 

Lightning, as can be guessed, it also critical. Rockets are high conductors, and having the potential for lightning can be extremely dangerous. Even if there isn't lightning currently happening, the rocket launch itself could cause lightning to occur given the "right" conditions. 

The shape and composition of clouds indicate the likelihood of lightning and will be one of the primary factors in determining whether a rocket launches, and which trajectory it will take.
