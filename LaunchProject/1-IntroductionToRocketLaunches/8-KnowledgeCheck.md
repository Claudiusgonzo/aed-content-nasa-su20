# Knowledge Check

Computers will always be more accurate than humans at data analysis
- True, they are purely logical and so cannot make mistakes
- True, they are able to process significantly more data, faster
- False, they can never understand context and so can't be accurate
- False, they are as accurate as the software built by humans can make them *

What are the four steps in the data science lifecyle?
- Business Understanding, Data Gathering and Preparation, Model Training and Testing, Model Deployment *
- Data Gathering, Data Validation, Machine Learning, Result Visualization
- Data Identification, Model Training until 100% Accurate, Model Deployment, Business Understanding
- Machine Learning Algorithm Coding, Data Exploration, Algorithm Modifications, Report Generation
