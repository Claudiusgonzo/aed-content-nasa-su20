# Learning Path Introduction

Rocks. Since we were young we learned that rocks can tell stories. From fossils to the shape and composition of a rock, each individual rock tells a rich narrative about where it's come from and how it came to be. 

NASA scientists have been studying rocks for decades. Not just to discover what they are made of, but to understand how they have come to be. The nuances of rocks found on the Moon and rocks that come to Earth (meteorites) tell rich and complex narratives about how our universe was created and the importance of continuing to explore it. 

In this learning path, you will touch the surface (pun intended) of how scientists begin to research the nuances of rocks, and the complexities that data science can begin to make simpler. These modules are designed to give you a sneak peak into the scientific discovery of space - what we can achieve is greater than we ever imagined.

Through these 3 modules, you will:

- Learn about artificial intelligence, specifically image classification
- Setup your local environment to begin analyzing images of rocks from NASA
- Use machine learning to extract features out of images to classify them
- Build a neural network to train your machine learning model and predict new rock samples

Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of Python for Data Science (link to previous learning path)
