# Example of a Space Rock Mission

There are lots of missions that have taken astronauts and rovers to the moon to search for these rocks. One of which is the [OSIRIS-Rex mission](https://www.asteroidmission.org/objectives/).

This mission consists of launching a rocket to orbit an asteroid named Bennu whose regolith space rock may record the earliest history of our solar system. This mission is all about finding out more about where we came from and what our destiny is.

This mission is unique compared to the other types of missions that we have talked about. The OSIRIS-REx is not actually going to touch down on the asteroid, rather take very high quality pictures while in orbit. These pictures will get send to rock experts on Earth who will analyze features of them that could give us information about our solar system.
