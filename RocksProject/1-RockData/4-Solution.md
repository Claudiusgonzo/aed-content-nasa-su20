# A Solution to the Struggle

Integrating Artificial Intelligence technology into this process could result in many of these struggles being alleviated. For example, we could send astronauts to the moon armed with a computer that can take pictures of rocks and tell the astronaut what type it is and if it should pick it up or not. This same computer could be placed in a rover that could autonomously drive around the moon and scan for rocks that we need.

Along with this, on Earth it could mean that anyone could go searching for space rocks and use this program to tell them what type of rock they found.
