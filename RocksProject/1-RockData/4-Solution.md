# A Solution to the Struggle

Integrating Artificial Intelligence technology into this process could result in many of these struggles being alleviated. For example, we could send astronauts to the moon armed with a computer that can take pictures of rocks and tell the astronaut what type it is and if it should pick it up or not. This same computer could be placed in a rover that could autonomously drive around the moon and scan for rocks that we need.

Along with this, this software could be used on Earth it could mean that anyone could go searching for space rocks and use this program to tell them what type of rock they found.

This is just one way that Artificial Intelligence could be applied to collecting space rocks. We could also make a program to analyze pictures of the surfaces of planets and tell us what types of rocks are there or even create a program to search for planet to look like Earth.
