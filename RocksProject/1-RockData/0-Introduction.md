# The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Space Exploration

As technology advances, many disciplines outside of Computer Science have found ways to introduce these technologies into their work. One newer piece of technology that is being applied to many tasks is Artificial Intelligence.

This is the second lesson of a series of Microsoft Learn modules that highlight how NASA might apply Artificial Intelligence in their projects. From teaching a computer to detect which rock an astronaut should pick up based on its type to predicting if a rocket will be able to launch on a certain day, these new technologies can be applied to lots of projects.

Furthermore, others have already written a lot of code that we can leverage to use this technology in a way that we couldn't if we built it ourselves. For example, with the use of free tools and libraries, like PyTorch, you can start to build amazing projects and make discoveries that would have taken our ancestors decades.

While some spend their whole life learning about Artificial Intelligence, this second learning path will set you up with the basic tools to get started and this module in particular will provide the context for why these problems are interesting in the first place.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will begin looking about a problem that could be solved with an Artificial Intelligence program. Along the way you will learn:

- What space rocks are and what we do with them
- What are the upcoming space exploration missions

## Prerequisites

- None
