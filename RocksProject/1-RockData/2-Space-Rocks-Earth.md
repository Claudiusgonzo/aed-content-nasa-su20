# Space Rocks on Earth

As previously mentioned, a prominent place to gather space rocks is actually on our Earth. However, while planned missions target specific types of space rocks, on Earth we are at the mercy of what type of meteor decides to crash into Earth

## Where are these found

Currently, Antarctica is a major spot for finding meteorites that have crashed into Earth, but again they could be found anywhere around the globe. Antarctica is a great location for searching for meteorites because the black color of them stands out very well in the white snow and the cold climate helps preserve the organic chemicals in the rocks. If you ever go to Antarctica and see a black rock on the ground, pick it up because it is most likely a space rock.
