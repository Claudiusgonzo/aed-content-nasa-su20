# The struggles of collecting space rocks

While you may think the hard part of collecting space rocks is over after you have flown a rocket 238,855 miles to the moon, you would be mistaken. Even after astronauts or a rover have made it to the moon, picking the correct rocks becomes a very large challenge. Not only do rockets not have much space for cargo, but there are so many types of space rock out there and choosing which ones to pick up and which ones to not is a very difficult process.

## Teaching Astronauts

Astronauts already have a lot of things to prepare prior to a launch to space/the moon and space rocks aren't super easy to identify. For example, there are the more common types of space rocks like basalt and regolith (soil), but there is also a kind of rock known as breccias which are a combination of rocks smashed together. This means that rocks may look like the ones the astronauts are instructed to get, when you look at the chemical composition of them, they are not the right ones.

Another aspect of gathering space rocks that might be hard to conceptualize is the procedure for picking up rocks that look "different". If you see a white rock surrounded by all black rocks, the normal instinct is to pick up said white rock and ignore all the others. However, this is not how to gather space rocks. You must pick get a large sample of the black rocks in the area to get an idea of that area. A common trick is to just pick up 10 "average" rocks in the area and then start looking for the more unique rocks.

## Using Rovers

Having Astronauts learn about rocks is one thing, but controlling rovers to pick up the correct rocks on the moon is also difficult. For one, to send instructions to a rover so far away takes lots of time, so many instructions have to be simple (like move forward, turn right, ect.).
