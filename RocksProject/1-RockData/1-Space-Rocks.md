# The Importance of Rocks and Soil

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) that we will be focusing on in this learning path is having a computer classify Moon rocks. While you may be wondering why we are learning about something as commonplace as rocks, there are many amazing things that we can learn from and do with Moon rocks.

## What are space rocks

Before we jump in to why we are choosing Moon rocks, let's first classify rocks and soil that don't originate from Earth. 

Rocks and soil from Space come in many sizes ranging from tiny specs of soil found on the Moon to planet-sized boulders floating through space. They can also be found in a few different forms: flying through space (known as meteors or asteroids) or just regular rocks found on the surface of other planets. Additionally, even though space rocks cannot be from Earth doesn't mean that they can't be found on Earth. Meteors that crash into something are called Meteorites. There are loads of space rocks found on Earth that come from meteors crashing through Earth's atmosphere and landing all over the world (we will talk more about space rocks on Earth in a later section).

## Why space rocks

Where to start. When I first started learning about space rocks, I thought "Why does NASA keep sending rockets to the moon to get space rocks?" (Please don't tell NASA I said that). However, there are so many different uses of space rocks, many of which will not even be covered here because of the sheer amount of them.

For one, rocks tell us about the history of our universe. They have been here much longer than we have been here and will be here much longer after we are gone. For example, we have a lot of the rock granite on Earth, but is very uncommon everywhere else in the solar system. This can tell us that most likely a granite asteroid hit Earth at some point when it was forming.

Along with finding out about the history of the universe, we study them to prepare for the future. While it may seem like a long ways away now, but at some point we could be harvesting space rocks as a resource in a similar way we gather wood from trees now on Earth. Many space rocks have gasses and rare chemical compounds in them not found on Earth. In the future, we could potentially use these resources to create new technology on Earth.

The final example of things that studying space rocks can do for us is help us find signs of life. There are many rocks in the universe that are water-bearing and if we know a lot about these rocks, we can search for planets that contain these rocks and potentially find life.
