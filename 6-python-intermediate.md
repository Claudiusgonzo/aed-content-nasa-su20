# Python Intermediate

Now that you have been introduced to some basic concepts of python and computer science, we will now add a little spice that comes in the form of logic. 

## Conditionals

Conditionals can be thought of only doing something when a certain criteria is met. A real world example would if I don't turn my homework in, then my grade will go down. We can see this below in the context of Artemis by seeing if we found any Basalt rocks.

```python
if(basalt == 0):
    print("we have found no basalt rocks")
```

## Loops

## Functions

Functions are ways that we can make our code cleaner and easier to work with. 

## Libraries
