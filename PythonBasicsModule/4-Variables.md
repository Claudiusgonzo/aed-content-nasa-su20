# Variables

In this unit, you will learn about variables in Python. Variables are containers that you can store data within and use at a different time.

There are four main variable types:

- Integers (int): These are whole numbers like 1,4,10
- Floats: These are decimal numbers like 0.3, 1.6, 17.4
- String: These are chains of characters which are surrounded by single or double quotes like "hi", "NASA", "Space Rocks"
- Boolean: Represents either True or False

Try copying the code below to make some of your own variables:

```python
# Integer Variable
numberOfRocks = 5

# Float Variable
tempInSpace = -457.87

# String Variable
stringVar = "Artemis Rover"

# Boolean Variable
rocketOn = False

```

An aspect of Python that makes it unique to other programming languages is that you do not need to tell it what type of variable you are making. For example in some languages if you want to make an integer in some languages you must let the computer know you are about to make an integer.
(int intVar = 0)

In our project, we will be using variables to store the number of a certain type of rock we find. One of the main types of moon rock is called Basalt. We can make a variable named basalt and give it a value of 0 by using the following code:

```python
# Create integer variable named Basalt with value 0
basalt = 0
```

We can also change the value in the variable:

```python
basalt = 3
basalt = basalt + 1
```

This would be good if we wanted to tell the computer we have three rocks found so far and we just found another.
