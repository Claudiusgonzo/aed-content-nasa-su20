# Arithmetic

Math is used frequently in computer science and the concepts will be great tools for your coding arsenal. Python has many features that allow you to perform computations on numbers.

## Simple Calculations

Similar to a calculator you, can use the operators + , - , * , and / in Python.

For example, write the following in the editor and then click the run button to see the output.

```python
# Combining two piles of space rocks
3 + 6
```

```python
# Lose three units of oxygen
15 - 3
```

```python
# Finding how far a rocket has gone by multiplying speed by time travelling
17000 * 2
```

```python
# Number of rocks per pile if we separate 10 space rocks in 4 piles
10 / 4
```

Furthermore, just like on calculators, the order of operations is in play and you can use parenthesis to combat this.
Try copying the code below into a Jupyter notebook cell and running it. Notice how you get two different numbers.

```python
 2 + 5 * 3
(2 + 5) * 3
```

This is because the order of operations computes multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

## More Advanced Math

There are also more advanced calculations that Python can compute listed below:

- To calculate remainder, use %

```python
# How many rocks will be left when we divide 10 rocks into 3 even piles
10 % 3
```

- To calculate exponents, use **

```python
# How many miles away the moon is
4 ** 9
```

- To remove the remainder when dividing, use //

```python
# How many even piles of 2 we can make with 5 rocks
5 // 2
```
