# Using comments in Python

Over the course of this module, we will be using comments in our code. Learning how to use comments efficiently will greatly improve the readability of your code.

## What comments are

In programming, comments words in code that the computer will not take into account when running. This means their sole purpose is to help out developers looking at code. They are great for explaining complex code to others, helping you remember what a certain part of your code did, and reminding you of what needs to be added to your code.

## How to use comments

In Python, comments are as simple as including a # before the code you type.

```python
# This is a comment
```

As noted previously, comments are not run by the computer. If you look at the code below 2 + 2 is commented out so the computer will only computer 2 + 3.

```python
# 2 + 2
2 + 3
```

## Some examples of good commenting

```python
