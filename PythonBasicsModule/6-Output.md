# Output

Now that we have made some variables and have given them some values we may want to see what the values are. To do this we will use a command called print(). This is called a function (you will learn more about functions in the next section) which is code others have wrote that we can use. The print() function will make the computer write the values in you variables to the screen.

Try to print some values to the console by using the code below:

```python
print(6)
print("Hello World")
```

Along with only values, we can use the code below to print a variable.

```python
numRocks = 15
print(numRocks)
```

Finally, we can combine variables and strings by using the following code:

```python
numBasalt = 4
print("The number of Basalt rocks found:", numBasalt)
```

This knowledge will be very helpful to output the rock data we find so others can more easily see the data we find.
