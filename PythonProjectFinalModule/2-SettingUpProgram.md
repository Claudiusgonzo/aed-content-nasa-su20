# Setting up program and variables

Let's begin by starting with a fresh slate. You can do this by either deleting everything in the file that you have been playing around in or by making a new Python file.

To start our program, we will want to let the user know that the program is beginning. To do this, we will use the print command to output a string of text.

```python
print("Artemis Rover Rock Scanner Starting")
```

Next, we are going to want to create some variables which are going to represent the different types of rocks that Artemis encountered on the Moon. The specific rocks that we are looking for are: Basalt: The Mare Rock, Breccia: Shocked Rock, Highland Rock: Anorthosite, and Regolith Soil/Surface Layer. Let's make some variables with names of "basalt", "breccia", "highland", and "regolith". We can also set these variables to 0 since we have not counted any rocks yet.

```python
basalt = 0
breccia = 0
highland = 0
regolith = 0
```
