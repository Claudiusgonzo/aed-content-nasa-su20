# Introduction

You are a geologist working at NASA responsible for analyzing the different types of rocks found by the Artemis Rover and producing a report. The rover will send a text document of the different types of rocks found and you need to parse through this. Instead of doing it by hand, your friend tells you about how the Python programming language can make this task much easier and more automated.

In this module, you will build a simple Python program to complete this task. Along the way, you will be introduced to a variety of introductory computer science topics and then you will apply this knowledge to create a program to do this job. You will use Visual Studio Code with the Python extension to run the code and utilize pre-build functions that will help complete this exercise.

## Learning objectives

In the units following, you will learn many computer science topics and use them to create an end-to-end solution. Along the way, you will learn:

- How to install VS Code and a little bit about the benefits of this program
- How to install extensions to enhance the VS Code experience
- How to use a variety of python functions
- How to run a program
- Some essential computer science principles

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, Mac or Linux computer
- Knowledge of how to download programs from internet
