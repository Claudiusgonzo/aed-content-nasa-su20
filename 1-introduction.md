# Introduction

You are a geologist working at NASA in charge of analyzing the different types of rocks found by the Artemis rover and producing a report. The rover will send a text document of the different types of rocks found and you need to parse through this. Instead of doing it by hand (because there are a lot of rocks on the moon Artemis sees), your friend tells you about how using the Python program language can make this task much easier and more automated.

In this module, you will build a simple python program to complete this task. Along the way, you will be introduced to a variety of introductory computer science topics and then will apply this knowledge to create a program to do this job. You will use Visual Studio Code with the python extension to run the code and utilize pre-build libraries that will help complete the exercise.

## Learning objectives

In the units following, you will learn many computer science topics and use them to create an end-to-end solution. Along the way, you will learn:

- How to install VS Code and a little bit about the benefits of this program
- How to install extensions to enhance the VS Code experience
- Some essential computer science principles
- How to run a program
- How to use a variety of python libraries

## Prerequisites

- A computer running Windows, Mac or Linux
- Knowledge of how to download programs
