# Output

Now that we have created some variables and have given them some values, we can learn of some other ways to view them. To do this, we will use a function called print(). Jupyter Notebook can be very useful because it does not require us to type the print command to see an output, like we would normally have to do when using Python. Additionally, if you do not use the print function, Jupyter Notebook will only print the final code you have written. For example only 8 (5 + 3) is printed out:

```python
2 + 2
5 + 3
```

>8

The print function, like the functions we have called earlier when using strings, is code written by others that we can use. The print() function will make the computer write the values within the variable you have given.

Try to print some values to the console by using the code below:

```python
print(6)
print("Hello World")
```

>6  
>Hello World

Along with only values, we can use the code below to print a variable.

```python
numRocks = 15
print(numRocks)
```

>15

We can combine variables and strings by putting a comma in between them:

```python
numBasalt = 4
print("The number of Basalt rocks found:", numBasalt)
```

>The number of Basalt rocks found: 4

```python
date = "February 26"
numRocks = 15
print("On", date, "number of rocks found:", numRocks)
```

>On February 26 number of rocks found: 15

The print function is very helpful because the people using our programs won't always be able see our code or not know how to read our code. The print function allows us to only show them the data we want them to see.
