# Introduction to Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is the programming language you will be using throughout this learning path. Although it may seem that you are only learning about one programming language, the concepts learned here can be applied to numerous other languages.

## A little bit about Python

Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and is named after the television show Monty Python. Python is a high level programming language which means, from the programmer's point of view, the code is closer to reading like a natural language (English) and therefore easier to read and write. Python does more heavy lifting behind the scenes to convert more natural language instructions into commands that a computer can execute.

## Why Python

Out of all the programming languages out there, you may be asking why we choose Python. Over the past 15 years, Python has become increasingly more popular and it is often known as a great beginner programming language. Moreover, it is very versatile and can be applied to many more advanced computing topics such as data science and machine learning. Finally, Python has many packages and libraries (code written by others) that you can include in your own projects that cut down on the code you need to write.

## Real World Examples of Python at Work

Examples of software that include Python code are YouTube, Dropbox and Google. [NASA even has a page of open sourced projects](https://code.nasa.gov/), many of which are programmed in Python.

## Jupyter Notebooks and Python

To learn Python, we will be using a type of file called [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Notebooks support Python in a read-eval-print loop (REPL) style, meaning users can write a few lines of code in one file, execute them *within* the file, and then write more code and continue executing. Jupyter Notebooks also support being able to re-run "cells" (chunks of code). This kind of coding environment creates a great learning experience when learning a new programming language.
