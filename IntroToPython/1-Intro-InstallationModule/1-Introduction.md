# Introduction

Welcome to the first of many modules showing you real-life examples of how NASA might use Microsoft technologies to assist them in their space-related endeavors. A big part of why NASA is so successful is the powerful software they create. If you want to be part of NASA, knowing how to code would be an invaluable skill. Lucky for you, this module and learning path will take anyone with a desire to code and give them a great coding foundation. Throughout the various NASA-themed learning paths, you will see NASA-themed coding examples and even create a program to read and summarize data about space rocks.

In this module, you will be introduced to Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks. You will learn how to install all of the software and packages you will need to begin writing code and writing programs to explore NASA data.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn about and test software that assist developers, particularly in data exploration. Along the way you will learn:

- What a programming language is
- How to install Visual Studio Code and the benefits of this code editor
- How to install extensions to enhance the Visual Studio Code experience
- How to install Python and why it is such a popular programming language
- How to run a basic Jupyter Notebook within Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites
