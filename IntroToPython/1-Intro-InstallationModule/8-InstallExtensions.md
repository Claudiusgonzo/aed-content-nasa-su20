# How to Install Extensions

In this unit, you will learn about the extension tab in Visual Studio Code and how to install the Python and IntelliCode extension.

## Installing Python Extension

To access all of the Python open-sourced tools that will be helpful for this learning path, click on the extension tab in Visual Studio Code. It looks like three blocks in the shape of an "L" and another block floating to the right.

You can explore the extensions marketplace and install any extensions you would like, but for this tutorial, we will be installing the Python extension. After you are inside of the extension marketplace, go to the search bar and type in "Python". You are looking for the extension named solely Python and published by Microsoft (it should be the first result). Click on the extension and then click "install".

After installation, you should close out of Visual Studio Code and open it again to ensure that Visual Studio Code recognizes the Python extension as installed.

The Python extension is now installed. This extension lets you create Python and Jupyter Notebook files that can help you write correctly formatted code, fix typos, and allow you to run the code that you write.

## Installing IntelliCode Extension

While in the extensions tab, go back to the search bar and type in "intellicode". Click on the specified box (which should be the first result) and click install. IntelliCode will recommend code when you are writing your programs. This is a great tool for beginners because you might not know the exact syntax for some code.
