# Learning Path Introduction

The technological world around us thrives on innovation, passion, and persistance. When first learning to code, it is important that you identify all three along your journey. 

This learning path introduces you to the world of Python. But the goal is not to learn Python, the goal is to understand how Python plays a role in the innovative solutions that NASA creates. Through the lens of space discovery, this learning path could ignite a passion to persistently learn, discover, and create so that you too can one day help us all understand a little more about the world beyond our Earth.

Through these ten modules, you will:

- Learn about and install the tools needed to begin learning programming
- Learn core programming concepts and apply them to real-life NASA problems
- Learn about hot technologies like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- See actual NASA employees talk about their job and give advice
