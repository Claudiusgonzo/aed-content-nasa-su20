In order to modify the rock count variables in the function we created we had to make them global variables:
True

How did we call the countMoonRocks function?

for rock in rockList:
    countMoonRocks(rock)

for rockList in rock:
    countMoonRocks(rockList)

while rockList:
    countMoonRocks(rock)

while rock:
    countMoonRocks(rock)

What code did we call after we finished reading data from the rocks.txt file?

.close()
.end()
.finish()
.done()
