# Python Basics

Now that we have Python running in VS Code we can now proceed to learn how to use these tools to complete our Moon rock mission.

## Arithmetic

Similar to a calculator you can use the operators + , - , * , and /.

For example write the following in the editor and click the run button to see the output

```python
2 + 2
```

```python
15 - 3
```

```python
5 * 2
```

```python
10 / 5
```

## Strings

In way that is easier to understand, think of strings as just words. If you want to dive deeper they are a string of character (that is why they are called strings). You have already got some experience with strings when you printed out the hello world in the last unit.

You can make a string by enclosing words in double quotes. Below are some examples of strings that the Artemis rover might output.

```python
"Artemis Rover is Online"
```

## Variables

Variables are basically containers that you can store data in and use at a different time. 

To initialize a variable and give it a name start by choosing any name and then using the "=" to give it a value.

In our example we will be using variables to store the number of a certain type of rock we find. One of the main types of moon rock is called Basalt. We can make a variable named basalt and give it a value of 0 by using the following code

```python
basalt = 0
```

We now have a variable named basalt that we can do various things to. We can use the print() command that we used above to print its value

```python
print(basalt)
```

Or we can change the value in the variable

```python
basalt = basalt + 1
```

There are also many things that we can do with strings and variables. 

## Output
