# Conditionals and Conditions

## Conditionals

Many times when programming we only want to perform a certain action when a certain condition is met. For example if we see a Basalt rock, we will want to add 1 to our Basalt variable.

## Conditions

Conditions are what needs to be met before we do a certain task. We can use logical operators to compare two values. The logical operators will then return either a True or a False value (boolean).

Below are some common logical operator:

- Equals: x == y
- Not Equals: x!=y
- Less than: x < y
- Less than or equal to: x <= y
- Greater than: x > y
- Greater than or equal: x >= y
