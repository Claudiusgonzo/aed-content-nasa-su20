# Introduction

You are a geologist working at NASA responsible for analyzing the different types of rocks found by the Artemis Rover and producing a report. The rover will send a text document of the different types of rocks found and you need to parse through this. Instead of doing it by hand, your friend tells you about how the Python programming language can make this task much easier and more automated.

In this module, you will build a simple notebook with Python to complete this task. Along the way, you will apply a variety of introductory computer science topics. You will use Visual Studio Code with the Python extension to run the code and utilize pre-build functions that will help complete this exercise.

## Learning Objectives

In the units following, you will learn many computer science topics and use them to create an end-to-end solution. Along the way, you will learn:

- How to write variables in the context of a program
- How to use prebuilt  functions to read data from a text file
- How to create a function and call it in the context of a program
- How to write conditionals and loops in the context of a program

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed
- Python Extension installed in Visual Studio Code
- Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed
- Knowledge about introductory Python topics
