# Discover the Power to Solve Problems using Visual Studio Code

With a brief introduction to code, you can move on to learning about tools developers use to assist them in coding. Specifically, in this unit, you will learn about code editors and Visual Studio Code.

## What is Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (also referred to as VS Code) is a free, open-sourced, extensible, code editor. We can break this description down a little farther to get a better understanding:

- **Code editor**: A code editor that is made specifically for writing, running and debugging code. Code editors are comparable to an application like Microsoft Word, but with added functionally like autocomplete of code functions and ability to execute (run) code.

- **Open-source**: Open Source Software (OSS) has it's code available for anyone to explore, modify, and enhance. The main takeaway from this is that if there is a missing feature in software like Visual Studio Code, someone (even you) can build that feature and contribute it back to the source code so that everyone can have access to that feature. You can find the [open-source Visual Studio project on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)

- **Extensible**: To be able to be extended and expanded. In the context of Visual Studio Code, being extensible means that you will be able to download (or even create) extensions (think mods in a game or customizations) to make Visual Studio Code exaclty right for your workstyle. If the color scheme is hurting your eyes or an obscure programming language isn't supported, you can customize Visual Studio Code to add new colors and support for the language. You can find the [Visual Studio Code extensions on the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) or discover how to [build your own extension on the Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api).

## Why Visual Studio Code is popular in the developer community

One common assumption is that Visual Studio Code's popularity is due to it being free, which *is* a big reason, but there are plenty of other editors that are also free. As mentioned, Visual Studio Code is open-sourced and has a massive community of developers working to bring new features to it. Currently, almost every major programming language is supported in Visual Studio Code. Additionally, for each language, framework, or work style - there is likely an extension to support developers to have a better experience. Along with this, many have praised it for its ease to set up and get running on all platforms - even in a browser with the release of [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/)!

Whatever your reason, [Visual Studio Code is one of the best editors](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools), especially for a tutorial such as this one. With a small setup effort, we can reach the majority of learners and work towards a similar experience regardless of physical machine.
