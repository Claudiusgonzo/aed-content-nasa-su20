# (Optional) Exercise - Run Visual Studio Code in your Browser for Data Exploration

> [!NOTE]
> This is an optional section that you should only follow if you want to use Visual Studio Code in the browser and not downloaded onto your computer. The rest of the module will depict the instructions using a downloaded version of Visual Studio Code.

One of the great things about Visual Studio Code is that Microsoft Azure gives you the opportunity to run the program in your browser using [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/). This means that you can begin your Python coding journey without having to download any software.

## Create a Microsoft Azure Account

To start using this code editor in your browser, you must first create a free Microsoft Azure account. Start by going to this [link](https://portal.azure.com/). Either sign in with a Microsoft account or create a free account. 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure has free accounts for both [professionals/individuals](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and [students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). 

## Instructions to set up Codespaces

To run Python using Jupyter Notebooks from within Visual Studio Code, you will use Visual Studio Codespaces. As with most Visual Studio Code features, you can find [a quick startup guide to Codespaces here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/online/quickstarts/browser).

> [!WARNING]
> [Visual Studio Codespaces does have a minimal fee](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/visual-studio-online/) paid for through your Azure subscription. The cost for a bsic instance at the time of publishing this module is $0.085 per hour. For a comprehensive list of the cost, you can check out the [Visual Studio Codespaces pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?service=visual-studio-online). With the use of either a [professionals/individuals](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or [students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) free account, you shouldn't have to pay for anything to complete this Learning Path.

## Configuring Visual Studio Codespaces

Once you are connected to Visual Studio Codespaces, you will be greeted with a welcome window. Let's start be closing this window. You will see on the left side of the screen that there are a variety of icons you can click on. Below is a brief overview of a few of the sections that we will be using.
