# Exercise - Import and Clean Space Rock Data

Now that we know about cleaning and separating the data, we can actually apply these principles to our rock classification project.

Let's start by downloading all of the rock image data and putting it into the same folder that your Jupyter Notebooks file is in. Go to [this Azure Blob storage](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Storage/ContainerMenuBlade/overview/storageAccountId/%2Fsubscriptions%2F4c3c2dd8-b391-4b47-9ba2-57f760bf278c%2FresourceGroups%2FNASA-Learn%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Storage%2FstorageAccounts%2Fnasadata/path/nasarocks/etag/%220x8D817FE9313AD8B%22/defaultEncryptionScope/%24account-encryption-key/denyEncryptionScopeOverride//defaultId//publicAccessVal/Container) and download the `Data.zip` folder. Unzip it and put it in the same folder as your Jupyter Notebooks file.

Since the the rock images come in different sizes (small, medium, large), we will crop all images to transform them into the same size (224*224 pixels). We need to resize all the images because computers expect images to be all same size, otherwise they get confused about differences in sizes.

We resize the images in the first part of the code and at the bottom of the code you can see that we separate the data into a training variable and a testing variable.

```python
# telling the machine what folder contains the image data
data_dir = './data'

# function to read the data, crop and resize the images and then split it into test and train chunks
def load_split_train_test(datadir, valid_size = .2):
    # this line of code transforms the images
    train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
                                       transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
                                       transforms.Resize(224),
                                       transforms.ToTensor(),
                                       ])

    test_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
                                          transforms.Resize(224),
                                          transforms.ToTensor(),
                                      ])

    train_data = datasets.ImageFolder(datadir, transform=train_transforms)
    test_data = datasets.ImageFolder(datadir, transform=test_transforms)

    num_train = len(train_data)
    indices = list(range(num_train))
    split = int(np.floor(valid_size * num_train))
    np.random.shuffle(indices)
    from torch.utils.data.sampler import SubsetRandomSampler
    train_idx, test_idx = indices[split:], indices[:split]
    train_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(train_idx)
    test_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(test_idx)
    trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, sampler=train_sampler, batch_size=16)
    testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_data, sampler=test_sampler, batch_size=16)
    return trainloader, testloader

# Using 20% of data for testingS
trainloader, testloader = load_split_train_test(data_dir, .2)
print(trainloader.dataset.classes)
```
