# Discover the Importance of Cleaning and Separating Data for AI Projects

Now that we have all of the correct libraries imported, the next step is to import the data of existing rock images to teach our computer to recognize different types of rocks.

Before you this, however, you must learn about some steps in the machine learning process called cleaning and separating data. These are necessary actions that you need to apply to the data to ensure that your computer will be able to accurately classify the rock images.

## Cleaning Data

Cleaning data means that we look at all of the data and ensure that there is nothing missing and that everything is uniform. In our rock example, many of the pictures have a variety of different image sizes and so to clean this data we will have to resize every picture. Other examples of this include filling in missing columns of a spreadsheet is there is no data recorded for that cell or deleting certain rows of data that have incorrect data.

## Separating Data

As mentioned before, to program Artificial Intelligence we must first give the computer lots of data and tell it what that data represents. This process is called training and seeing if the computer can classify the new data you give to it is called testing. NASA gave us a lump of data of different rock types so another step we must take is tell the computer which data we are going to train the AI program with and which data we are going to test the AI program with. To separate data, all we do is randomly separate it into two groups: a training and testing. The ratio of how much data goes into each group can vary, but in our example we are going to be training with 80% of the data and testing with 20% of the data.
