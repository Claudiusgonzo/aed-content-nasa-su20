# The struggles of collecting space rocks

While you may think the hard part of collecting space rocks is over after you have flown a rocket 238,855 miles to the moon, you would be mistaken. Even after astronauts, or a rover, have made it to the moon, picking the correct rocks becomes a very large challenge. With limited space on rockets to bring samples back to Earth and so many types of space rock out there, choosing which ones to collect and which ones to leave behind is a very difficult process.

## Teaching Astronauts

Astronauts already have preparation prior to a launch into space and their priorities are often on a safe and successful journey. But one of the main goals of traveling to the Moon, for example, is to collect specimens so that we can better understand our universe. 

Have you ever walked along a rocky area and tried to pick out rocks that looked pretty? You could spend a good few hours looking over the surface of the Earth, trying not to miss anything special, but not wanting to get on your hands and knees and examine each rock. The surface of the Moon is pretty much all potential samples that an astronaut can take back. And the types of rocks are not easily identifiable at first glance.

For example, there are the more common types of space rocks like basalt, crustal, and regolith (soil), but there is also a kind of rock known as breccias which are a combination of rocks smashed together. This means that rocks may look like the ones the astronauts are instructed to get, when you look at the chemical composition of them, they are not the right ones. Furthermore, the rock images that you will look through in this learning path have already been cleaned and the pictures of them are in a studio with good lighting and really close up. Being able to identify these ont he Moon, through a space suit, without being to feel it, and with less than ideal lighting makes it even more of a challenge.

## Uniqueness isn't always desireable

Another aspect of gathering space rocks that might be hard to conceptualize is the procedure for picking up rocks that look "different". If you see a white rock surrounded by all black rocks, the normal instinct is to pick up said white rock and ignore all the others. However, this is not effective is the goal is to understand how and why that white rock is there amongst black rocks. Astronauts are asked to also collect samples of the black rocks in the area to get an accurate representation of the area. A common trick is to just pick up 10 "average" rocks in the area and then start collecting the more unique rocks.

## Using Rovers

Having Astronauts learn about rocks is one thing, but controlling rovers to pick up the correct rocks on the moon is also difficult. For one, to send instructions to a rover so far away takes lots of time, so many instructions have to be simple (like move forward, turn right, ect.). Furthermore, as you will see with this learning path, having a computer accurately identify rocks when they have been cleaned and professionally photographed is difficult, let along when there is dirt/dust covering them, the light is poor, there are shadows, and there is a lot of similar looking material surrounding them.
