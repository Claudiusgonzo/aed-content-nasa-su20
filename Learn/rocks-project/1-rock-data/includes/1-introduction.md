# Introduction

As technology advances, many disciplines outside of Computer Science have found ways to introduce these technologies into their work. One newer piece of technology that is being applied to many tasks is artificial intelligence (AI).

This is the second topic of a series of Microsoft Learn learning paths that highlight how artificial intelligence might influence NASA research and space exploration in general. From teaching a computer to detect which rock an astronaut should pick up based on its type, to predicting if a rocket will be able to launch on a certain day, AI can be a useful tool for the brilliant research minds behind some of our Earths most inspiring discoveries.

Furthermore, we've reached a point where services and libraries that do a lot of the complex math and algorithms around artificial intelligence exist and are widely available. For example, Python has a number of libraries and packages to explore, visualize, and analyze data, such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [Azure offers AI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/) to analyze images with a simple API call.

While there are still complexities and depth we won't cover in these Microsoft Learn modules, this learning path does introduce you to some basic AI tools and services and guides you through a practical use of them for introductory exploration of images of Moon rocks.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will use artificial intelligence to build an aid to Moon rock classification techniques. Along the way you will learn:

- What space rocks are and what we do with them
- Why classifying space rocks is challenging and important

## Prerequisites

- Some Python experience
