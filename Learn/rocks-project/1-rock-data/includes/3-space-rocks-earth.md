# Learn About Where Space Rocks are Found on Earth

As previously mentioned, a prominent place to gather space rocks is actually on our Earth. However, while planned missions target specific types of space rocks, on Earth we are at the mercy of what type of meteorite decides to crash onto our surface. Furthermore, meteorites are covered with a fusion crust - an ash-like crust surrounding the rock preventing those who collect them from being able to properly identify them, until they are brought to the lab to be cleaned and analyzed.

## Where are these found

Antarctica is a major spot for finding meteorites that have crashed into Earth, but they could be found anywhere around the globe. Antarctica is a great location for searching for meteorites because the black color of the fusion crust stands out very well in the white snow. In other areas, the meteorites might be obfuscated by vegetation, blend in to the ground, or even just look like other rocks or debris in the area.

Antartica also offers a unique, constant, cold climate that helps preserve the organic chemicals in the rocks. In other areas, the shifts in temperature and percipitation, along with the impacts of humans in the area, makes the rock sample less likely to remain preserved. When conducting research on meteorites, ideally the rock is as preserved as possible to get a clear understanding of it's original composition. 

If you ever go to Antarctica and see a black rock on the ground, pick it up because it is most likely a space rock. You can read more about the space rocks found in Antarctica [in this article](https://www.britannica.com/science/Antarctic-meteorite).
