# Common AI Libraries in Python

Over the course of the project, we will be using the libraries listed below. They are all free and commonly used in real life artificial intelligence projects. Theses are just a few of the many libraries out there that may assist you in creating an artificial intelligence program.

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is primarily used for visualizing data in Python. It can create static, animated and interactive visualizations in Python. This is great for showing off your data in a more visual way.

## NumPy

NumPy, which is short for Numerical Python, is a popular library used for organizing and storing data in Python. NumPy can create structures for holding data called arrays which are similar to lists in which they store a lot of different data. NumPy also has many functions for manipulating data in these arrays.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is a machine learning library that has many built in functions to help accelerate building projects. Basically people have already made a foundational machine learning program and we are modifying it with our data. This saves us a lot of time and means we don't have to be a data science expert to build amazing projects.
