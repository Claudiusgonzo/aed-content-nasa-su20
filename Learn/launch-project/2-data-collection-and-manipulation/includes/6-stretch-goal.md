# Exercise - Consider Additional Data to Include

The choices that were made in this module were simplistic at best. While a rocket didn't technically launch the day before or after the Space X Dragon launch on May 30, 2020, it doesn't mean that a rocket launch would have been pushed due to weather on those days. So putting `N` in the Launched column for those dates is not really accurate. 

While the goal of these modules is to guide you through the practical steps to solving the problems faced during space exploration, you are also meant to discover your own path. The ultimate goal is to inspire you to create, ideate, and push limits to what we understand and the knowledge we collectively hold about our world and beyond. 

Take this opportunity to do more. Here are some ways to continue your learning and data journey:
1. Explore the data further: For each of the launches, look up articles and reports on them. Where there considerations made regarding weather pre-launch? Were there weather conditions around these dates that might have been worrisome?
2. Explore the missing weather data: What about the dates that NASA didn't choose to launch rockets? Not just the individual days, but were there seasons that were avoided? What kind of weather profile do those seasons tend to have?
3. Explore the missing launch data: Can you find data on launches that were pushed due to weather? Is there data from other countries on their launches that you might be able to incorporate? 
4. Explore other data manipulations: Are there better values that we could have used to fill in missing data? 
5. Decide what data you would want: If you had access to NASAs subject matter experts and data sources, what do you think would be most important to making a launch or push decision? If you could ask an expert something, what would it be?
6. Are there similar problems: Are there similar problems that could be used to help fill in this data? For example, could airplane delays due to weather in the area also be an indicator?

Being a data scientist isn't about having a complete data set and applying an algorithm to it - it's about starting from a place that is messy and likely wrong and learning in an iterative fashion. By the end of the rocket launches learning path, you will have learned *something* about rocket launches. With that new knowledge, you can come back to this module and make better informed decisions.
