# Explore the Rocket Launch Data to Gain an Understanding

To train a Machine Learning model, we have to collect as much data as possible
 - AI and Machine Learning systems need data to learn, without data they cannot learn anything!
 Therefore we first have to collect as much as data about launches as possible. For this learning path we have collected and used Microsoft excel to store them, here is a screenshot of the data collected.

As you can see, in this data we have a variety of different launches we are looking at with a variety of different attributes. Looking at the Pioneer 3 rocket on row 3 of the excel document it is apparent that we have have a lot of data about it. The rocket launches on December 6th, 1958 at 1:45 from the Cape Canaveral Space Center. Furthermore, there is weather data that has been gathered from the area around the launch site for that day.
