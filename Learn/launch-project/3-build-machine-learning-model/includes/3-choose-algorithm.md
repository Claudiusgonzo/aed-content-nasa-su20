# Exercise - Choose the Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Rocket Launch Success

Algorithm Cheat Sheet

```Python
# Create decision tree classifer 
tree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0,max_depth=5)
```

Next, we will build a machine learning algorithm to digest our data and find best weather patters for a launch 
- Machine learning algorithms take the data and return the insights about what are indicators of good rocket launch days
- We show these associations with links such as shown below:<br>
