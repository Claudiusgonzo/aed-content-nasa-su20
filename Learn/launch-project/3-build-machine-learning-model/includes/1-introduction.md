# Introduction
This module follows the previous two (link) modules within the Rocket Launches learning path. 

Previously you imported 300 rows of weather data representing 60 rocket launches plus the couple of days before and after a launch. Through a simplistic version of data cleansing and manipulation, you got your data to a place where you can start using machine learning algorithms to gather knowledge about it. 

In this module, you will use a decision tree classifier to gain knowledge from raw weather and rocket launch data. This module will focus on a local analysis of your data using scikit-learn.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will begin to discover: 
- The importance of column choosing
- How to split data to effectively train and test a machine learning algorithm
- How to train, test, and score a machine learning algorithm
- How to visualize a tree classification model

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python experience
- Have clean data about rocket launches
