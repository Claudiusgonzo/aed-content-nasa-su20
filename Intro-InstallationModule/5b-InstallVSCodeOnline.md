# Running VS Code in your browser

> [!NOTE]
> This is an optional section that you should only follow if you want to use VS Code in the browser and not downloaded. The rest of the module will be showing the instructor using a downloaded version of VS Code.

One of the great things about VS Code is that Microsoft Azure gives you the opportunity to run the program in your browser. This means that you can learn about coding all without downloading anything.

## Create a Microsoft Azure Account

To start using this program in your browser you must first create a free Microsoft Azure account. Start by going to this [link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/). Either sign in with a Microsoft account or create a free account.

## Instructions to set up Code spaces

To run the code in your browser we are going to be utilizing a Microsoft product named CodeSpaces. The concept of this is Microsoft downloaded the VS Code program on their computers and we are basically using their computer to run the program. A quick startup guide to get CodeSpaces working is found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/online/quickstarts/browser).

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft Codespaces does have a fee, however when creating a Microsoft Azure account you are given $200 credit. It should essentially be free.

## Configuring Code Spaces

Once you are connected to Code Spaces, you will be greeted with a welcome window. Let's start be closing this window. You will see on the left side of the screen there are a variety of icons you can click on. Below is a brief overview of a few of the sections that we will be using.
