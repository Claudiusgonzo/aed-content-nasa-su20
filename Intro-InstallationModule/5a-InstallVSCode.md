# Installing and Configuring Visual Studio Code

While it was great reading about these technologies, a much more exciting way to learn about them is to install them and begin playing around. This unit will teach you how to install VS Code.

## Installing VS Code

As mentioned before, VS Code is free and available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Simply click on the download box according to what OS you are running, then click on the executable file (the grey box at the bottom left of the screen) once it is done downloading to initiate the installation.

After clicking on the box, you will be asked to accept the license agreement, fill out preferences for the application and be asked where to install. Read over the license agreement and then click agree. On the preferences window, be sure to click the "Add to Path" box. Finally, click install on the final window to finish installation.

## Configuring VS Code

Once VS Code is installed, you may have the option to have it open on its own, however if you don't see this, just find the application on your computer and open it. When you first come into VS Code, you will be greeted with a welcome window. Let's start by closing this window. You will see on the left side of the screen that there are a variety of icons that you can click on that open other parts of VS Code. Below is a brief overview of a few of the sections that we will be using.

- Search: Allows you to look for a certain word or collection of words in your file.
- Run: This button will run the code you have written.
- Extensions: This is where you can see all of the additions that people from across the globe have added. There are different color themes, programming languages, and much more. You can install and customize VS Code to however you please.
