# Installing Python

Now that we have installed Visual Studio Code, we will need to download Python so our computer knows how to run and interpret the code we write.

> [!NOTE]
> Most Mac and Linux computers will come with Python pre-installed, however it might not be up to date.

To start, follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Click on the download button to begin the installation of Python. Click on the executable located at the bottom left of your screen and click run. Again, these instructions are for a windows computer, if you have Linux or Mac, use the links that correspond to your operating system.
