# What is a Programming Language

In the previous unit, we talked about how learning to code is a great skill. However, we never actually explained what coding is and why it is useful.

## What is code

Lines of code are instructions that we (humans) give to computers to make them do things. While you may hear about how smart and amazing computers are, on their own, they are fairly stupid. Code is how we tell the moon rovers where to go and rockets how to fly. Without code, computers would be nothing more than a heap of metal, but with code, we can instruct them on how to perform actions beyond the reach of humans.

## How do we code

To produce instructions for computers, we need to write in a language they understand. This communication comes in the form of programming languages. When anyone writes code, it is in one of many programming languages. The code written in these languages is translated further into ones and zeros, also called binary, that computers can read and perform the actions within. There are many programming languages throughout the world, all specializing in something different. Furthermore, anyone that writes code is know as a developer or programmer.

## Running and Debugging Code

After a developer has written code, they run the code which basically tells the computer to read the code and perform the instructions outlined in it. When you tell the computer to run the code it will do one of two things: successfully run the code or tell you there was an error somewhere.

These errors are known as bugs in your code and fixing them is known as debugging. Debugging is a big part of programming and a great skill you can apply to many other aspects of life.
