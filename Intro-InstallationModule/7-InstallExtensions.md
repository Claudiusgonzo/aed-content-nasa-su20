# How to Install Extensions

In this unit, you will learn about the extension tab in VS Code and how to install the Python extension.

## Installing Python Extension

To access all of the open-sourced-made tools we learned about, click on the extension tab in VS Code. It looks like three blocks in the shape of an "L" and another block floating to the right. You can play around and install any extensions you would like, but for this tutorial, we will be installing the Python extension. After you are inside of the extension page, go to the search bar and type in "Python". You are looking for the extension named solely Python (it should be the first result). Simply click on the box and then click "install".

After installation, you should close out of VS Code and open it again to ensure that VS Code recognizes the Python extension as installed.

The Python extension is now installed. This extension lets you create Python and Jupyter Notebook files that can help you write correctly formatted code, fix typos and allow you to run the code that you write.
