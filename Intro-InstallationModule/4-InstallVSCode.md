# Installing Visual Studio Code

While it was great reading about VS Code, a much more fun way to learn about it is to install it and begin playing around. This unit will teach you how to do exactly that.

## Installing VS Code

As mentioned before, VS Code is free and available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Simply click on the download box according to what OS you are running, then click on the grey box at the bottom left of the screen once it is done downloading.

> [!NOTE]
> The picture below depicts a user using a Windows computer, but you should choose the box that represents your system.

After clicking on the box, you will be asked to accept the license agreement and be asked where to install. Fill out these preferences and then finish the installation.

## Configuring VS Code

Once VS Code is installed, you may have the option to have it open on its own, however if you don't see this, just find the application on your computer and open it. When you first come into VS Code, you will be greeted with a welcome window. Let's start by closing this window. You will see on the left side of the screen that there are a variety of icons you can click on. Below is a brief overview of a few of the sections that we will be using.

- Explorer: Shows what file(s) you have open and shows the contents of the folder you are in, if you are in one.
- Search: Allows you to look for a certain word or collection of words in your file
- Run: This button will run the code you have written
- Extensions: This is where you can see all of the additions that people from across the globe have added. There are different color themes, programming languages, and much more. You can install and customize VS Code to however you please.
