# Understanding Visual Studio Code

Now that you have learned a little bit about what code is, in this section you will learn about tools developers use to assist them in writing it. Specifically, in this unit, you will learn about code editors and Visual Studio Code.

## What is Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (also referred to as VS Code) is a free, open-sourced, code editor. We can break this description down a little farther to get a better understanding:

- **code editor**: a text editor that is made specifically for writing, running and debugging code. They are comparable to an application like Microsoft Word, but with added functionally for writing code like autocomplete and ability to run code.

- **open-sourced**: software with code that anyone can look at, modify and enhance. The main takeaway from this is that if there is a feature not in the software, someone (or even you) has the ability to create it and add it to VS Code.

## Why VS Code is popular in the developer community

There are many reasons that this editor is so popular and many of these reasons were outlined in the paragraph above. One common assumption is that its popularity is due to it being free, which is a big reason, but there are plenty of other editors that are also free. As mentioned, VS Code is open-sourced and has a massive community of developers working to bring new features to it. Currently, almost every major programming language is supported in VS Code. Along with this, many have praised it for its ease to set up and get running. Finally, there is the option to run it in the cloud, meaning you don't have to even download the software.
