# Installing Python

Now that we have installed Visual Studio Code, we will need to download Python so our computer knows how to run and interpret the code we write.

To start follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Click on the download button to begin the install of Python. Click on the executable located at the bottom left of your screen and click run. You will now be taken to a setup window where you should follow the installation steps below:

- Ensure you have checked the box saying add Python 3.83 to path then click next.
- Next allow Python to make changes to this computer.
- Finally, wait for it to finish installing and click close.

Python is now installed and in the next unit, you will learn how to get a Python program running in VS Code.
