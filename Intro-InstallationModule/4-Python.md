# Introduction to Python

This unit will introduce you to Python, the programming language we will be learning about. Note that you may think you are only learning about one programming language, the concepts learned can be applied to numerous other languages.

## A little bit about Python

Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and is named after the television show Monty Python. Python is a high level programming language that means, from the programmer's point of view, the code is easier to read and write and Python does more heavy lifting behind the scenes. Finally, Python makes use of spaces and tabs for a lot of its syntax, which you will see later.

## Why Python

Out of all the programming languages out there, you may be asking why we choose Python. Over the past 15 years, Python has become increasingly more popular and it often known as a great beginner programming language. Moreover, it is very versatile and can be applied to many more advanced computing topics such as data science, machine learning, etc. Finally, Python has many available functions and libraries (code written by others) that you can include in your own projects that cut down on the code you need to write.

## Real World Examples of Python at Work

Examples of software that include Python code are YouTube, Dropbox, Google, and many more. NASA even has a page of open sourced projects, many of which are programmed in Python.

## Jupyter Notebooks and Python

To learn Python, we will be using a type of file called Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks uses the Python programming language, but it lets us run our code line by line (instead of all at once) making it great for learning a new language. This may be confusing at first, but Jupyter Notebooks is basically a type of file that uses Python and you will see how simple it is in the following units.
