# Introduction

Welcome to the first of many modules showing you real examples of how NASA might use Microsoft technologies to assist them in their space related endeavors. A big part of why NASA is so successful is the powerful software they create. If you want to be part of NASA, knowing how to code would be an invaluable skill. Lucky for you, this module and learning path will take anyone with a desire to code and give them a great computer science foundation. Along the way, you will see NASA themed coding examples and even make a project reading and summarizing data about space rocks.

In this module, you will learn all about Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks at a high level. You will walk through an exercise in which you install all of the software you need to begin running your first programs and even write some code.

## Learning Objectives

In the units following, you will learn about many softwares that assist developers and then install them on your own computer so you can test them out. Along the way you will learn:

- What a programming language is
- How to install Visual Studio Code and the benefits of this program
