# Accuracy

A big aspect of Artificial Intelligence is the accuracy that our program predicts the right outcome. In our case, accuracy is how likely the computer is to correctly identify a rock as being its true type.

The accuracy of AI in classification of rocks is shown below:

```python
print(accuracy/len(testloader))
```

```python
# lets save our neural network
torch.save(model, 'aerialmodel.pth')
```
