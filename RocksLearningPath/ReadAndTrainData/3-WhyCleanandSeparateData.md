# What is Cleaning and Separating Data

Now that we have all of the correct libraries imported, we can being importing the data of existing rock images to teach our computer to recognize different types of rocks.

Before we begin importing this data, you must learn about some steps in the machine learning process called cleaning and separating data. 

## Cleaning Data

Cleaning data means that we take all of the data and ensuring that there is nothing missing and that everything is uniform. In our rock example, many of the pictures have a variety of different sizes and so to clean this data we will have to resize every picture. Other examples of this include filling in missing columns of a spreadsheet is there is no data recorded for that cell or deleting certain rows of data that have incorrect data.

## Separating Data

As mentioned before, to program Artificial Intelligence we must first give the computer lots of data and tell it what that data represents. This process is called training and seeing if the computer can classify the new data you give to it is called testing. NASA gave us a lump of data of different rock types so another step we must take is tell the computer which data we are going to train the AI program with and which data we are going to test the AI program with.
