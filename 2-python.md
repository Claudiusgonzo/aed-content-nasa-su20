# Understanding Visual Studio Code and Python Extension

In this section you will learn more about visual studio code and why it is so popular. You will also learn about the Python programming language and see some industry examples of it.

## What is Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (also referred to as VS Code) is a free, open-sourced, code editor. We can break this description down a little farther to get a better understanding:

- **open-sourced**: software with source code that anyone can look at, modify and enhance. The main takeaway from this is that if there is a feature not in the software, someone (or even you) has the ability to create it and add it to VS Code.

- **code editor**: a text editor that is made specifically for writing and running source code. Comparable to an application like Microsoft Word, but with added functionally for writing code like autocomplete and ability to run code.

## Why VS Code is popular in the developer community

There are many reasons that this editor is so popular and many of these reasons were outlined in the paragraph above. One common assumption is to assume its popularity is due to it being free, which is a big reason, but there are plenty of other editors that are also free. As mentioned, VS Code is open-sourced and has a massive community of developers working to bring new features to it. Currently, almost every major programming language is supported in VS Code. Along with this, many have praised it for its ease to set up and get running. Finally, there is the option to run it in the cloud, meaning you don't have to even download the software.

## Programming Languages

In this module, you will be learning a little bit about the programming language Python. While it may seem like you are just learning one programming language, the concepts learned in Python (or any programming language) can be applied to many other languages. Before we get too far into Python, it will be good to know what a programming language is. Overall, programming languages are instructions that a computer will follow. While you may hear about how smart and amazing computers are, on their own, they are fairly stupid. The instructions (programming) is what makes them do amazing things.

## Introduction to Python

Out of all the programming languages out there, you may be asking why we choose Python. Over the past 15 years, Python has become increasingly more popular and it often known as a great beginner programming language. Moreover, it is very versatile and can be applied to many more advanced computing topics such as data science, machine learning, etc. Finally, Python has many available functions (code written by others) that you can include in your own projects that cut down on the code you need to write.
